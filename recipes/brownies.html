        <h2>Delightfully Fudgy Brownies</h2>

        <p>These cake-like brownies are the most delicious, fudgy treats that I have ever eaten. 
          They are so moist and super quick and easy to make. For best results, use Dutch-processed cocoa. 
          For less cake-like brownies, use all-purpose flour instead of self-rising.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
          <li>½ cup butter, melted</li>
          <li>2 large eggs</li>
          <li>½ cup self-rising flour</li>
          <li>⅓ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
          <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
          <li>½ cup chopped walnuts (Optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour an 8x8- or 9x9-inch baking pan.</li>
          <li>Beat together sugar and butter in a medium bowl. 
            Add eggs and mix well. Combine flour, cocoa, and salt; stir into sugar mixture. 
            Mix in vanilla, then stir in walnuts. 
            Spread evenly into the prepared pan.</li>
          <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are firm, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool before cutting into squares.</li>
        </ol>
